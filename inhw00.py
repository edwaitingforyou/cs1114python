1.Why Pyhthon is called "Pyhthon"?
First, I must introduce the father of Pyhthon, Guido van Rossum. He is a big fan of the comedy team Monty Python. When he finished Pyhthon writing Python in the Chirstmas 1989, he decided to use Python as the name of his program.
2.Why is the working environment called "IDLE"?
Idle maintains that there was little to do at the school and boredom drove him to study hard, and consequently won a place at Cambridge University.

3.Why does Gallagher use "Hello Grail" instead of the more traditional first program: "Hello Work"?
